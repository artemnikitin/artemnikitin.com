On the first day of New Year, I moved my blog from Ghost, hosted on Digital Ocean, to static blog, hosted with Github Pages.

I already thought about that for some time and today was a great time for that.

Initially, I thought about using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for generating static content, but at the end [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) was chosen.
