It finally happened!

After several attempts, I finally moved from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I'm also moved from Github Pages back to Amazon S3. If you're looking for a guide, try [this one](http://www.michaelgallego.fr/blog/2013/08/27/static-website-on-s3-cloudfront-and-route-53-the-right-way/). It mentioned some things that weren't clear in the process.
