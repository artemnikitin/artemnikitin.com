# Who is Artem Nikitin?    

From one point, he's just one of the 7 billionth people on Earth. From another point, you can see something special in him. You can see a true passion for software quality and engineering, genuine interest in new tools and practices, free mind and beating heart.        

I'm a Software Engineer with knowledge in these areas:    
- mostly `Java` and `Go`, but also with a little bit of `Groovy`, `Scala` and `Python` experience       
- `AWS` user since 2010     
- strong believer in `DevOps` approach, trying to make work easy for my team with different tools, scripts, and hacks      

Open source:         
- Contribution to several open source projects, including [Open AWS Guide](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws), [protoactor-go](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go), [autospotting](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting), [flatdata](https://github.com/heremaps/flatdata) and others   
- One of my repositories was mentioned in AWS [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-december-28-2015 )      

Recent talks:
